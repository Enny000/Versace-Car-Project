# Versace-Car-Project
Task from school


This is a school project where I developed a Python-based car sales analysis system using pandas and matplotlib. The program reads data from a CSV file containing car sales records and provides users with various interactive analysis options through a console-based menu system. Features include total sales reports (grouped by model or customized), new vs. used car comparisons over time, and performance tracking for individual salespeople. The project was a great opportunity to apply real-world data handling, conditional logic, and data visualization, helping me improve my understanding of Python, data analysis, and user-driven design.
